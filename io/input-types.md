These are the input types that we should probably consider:

# N cases per input

## One case per line, no preceding number

```
case one
case two
case three
```

## Number precedes each case

```
3
case one
case two
case three
2
secondcase one
secondcase two
```

# One case per input

These tend to vary, but are usually easy to parse.
